 * This MonoBehaviour loops through all of the conditions to check if they return true.

 * It then returns the condition's index that has the highest priority action.
 * Using that integer, it executes the associated action. This way, it prioritises all current conditions and executes the most important action right now.
 * 
 * TL;DR: It executes actions by priority.
